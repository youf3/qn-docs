Scheduling Module
============================

Two-level scheduler
------------------------------

Network level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :doc:`Controller </server>` has a global scheduler to handle network-wide
(global) non-real-time functions such as quantum network topology
discovery, quantum network monitoring, and quantum link calibration etc.
The controller also handles user requests on an event-driven basis. When
serving a user request, the controller performs alternating cycles between
calibration and operational mode. 

Node level
~~~~~~~~~~~
Each :doc:`Agent </agent>` implements a node with dedicated real-time control system.
Each node has a local scheduler to handle node-wide (local)
real-time functions that have tight time constraints, such as qubit
control and quantum protocol implementation etc.

User request handling

    Figure 1. User request handling in two-level scheduler

When a user requests an QN request, controller orchestrate the request
handling in following order.

1. The controller performs a request analysis. The request is admitted
   only if its requirement can be fulfilled. 
2. If the request is admitted, the controller proceeds to call a
   routingroutine to select a path to establish entanglement. 
3. The controller matches and assigns functions required for remote
   entanglement generation for each node along the path. We assume a
   singlefunction is required at each node, which are
   *func_ion_photon_entanglement* at Q-node A, *func_BSM* at BSM-node,
   and *func_ion_photon_entanglement* at Q-node B, respectively. The
   control framework has full knowledge of these functions, which are
   well-characterized and pre-configured.
4. The controller reaches out to Q-node A, BSM-node, and Q-node B for the
   time-slot allocation status of their local schedulers.
5. Q-node A, BSM-node, and Q-node B all reply with their local
   schedules.
6. The controller proceeds to call the network-wide scheduler to allocate
   common free time-slots for *func_ion_photon_entanglement* at Q-node
   A, *func_BSM* at BSM-node, and *func_ion_photon_entanglement* at
   Q-node B, such that these functions can be scheduled simultaneously
   at time T1. Afterwards, the controller updates Q-node A, BSM-node, and
   Q-node B with the newly assigned time-slots.
7. Q-node A, BSM-node, and Q-node B accept and confirm the newly
   assigned time-slots.
8. At time T1, the local schedulers run
   *func_ion_photon_entanglement* at Q-node A, *func_BSM* at BSM-node,
   and *func_ion_photon_entanglement* at Q-node B, respectively.

Calibration handling
--------------------

    Figure 2. Dependency handling using a DAG

When an Agent starts, its node-level scheduler manages local calibration
tasks as defined in the agent's configuration file. This ensures that
real-time devices remain calibrated and ready for incoming tasks. To
manage these calibration tasks, the agent reads the task section of its configuration file:

Example: ::

   [tasks]
   [[light_calibration]]
   path=dummy_lsrc_calibration.py

   [[light_calibration2]]
   path=dummy_lsrc_calibration.py

   [[cavity_calibration]]
   path=dummy_cavity_calibration.py


With the task definitions, it performs the following steps:

1. Each constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with an empty
   root node, based on the local calibration definitions from the
   configuration file. This DAG is used to track task dependencies. Each
   non-root node represents a calibration task, while the edges between
   nodes represent dependencies. Tasks with no dependencies are
   connected directly to the root node via an edge.
2. The DAG is traversed using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm,
   and tasks are scheduled in the agent's local schedule in the order
   they are encountered.
3. Initially, the state of all nodes is set to *OUT_OF_SPEC*. The DAG is
   periodically traversed using BFS to check the state of each node. If
   a calibration task is valid (i.e., it was performed correctly within
   the specified interval), the node’s state is updated to IN_SPEC. If a
   calibration task becomes invalid, the task and all its predecessors
   are set to *OUT_OF_SPEC*.
4. If the root node’s state changes between *IN_SPEC* and *OUT_OF_SPEC*, the
   agent sends a monitoring message to the controller to report the
   status change.

Controller-side request dispatch
---------------------------------

The controller distinguishes between experiment and calibration requests,
routing each through a dedicated execution path with its own protocol and
schema. Parameters are structured and typed before being forwarded to agents,
ensuring consistent handling regardless of request type. Errors during
allocation or result retrieval are reported with the identity of the
specific agent involved.
